# 🛡️ Purple Team Operations & Threat Emulation

Welcome to the **Purple-Team-Operations** repository — a comprehensive, hands-on guide to purple teaming practices that bridge the gap between red (attack) and blue (defense) teams. This project is ideal for cybersecurity professionals, SOC analysts, red teamers, and defenders who want to build and test detections collaboratively.

The content focuses on real-world offensive tactics and defensive strategies, using tools like **Atomic Red Team**, **ATT&CK Navigator**, **Elastic**, **Snort**, and **Splunk** — all documented in clean Markdown format for practical lab work.
